- Working escalators / elevators if there are events on multiple floors, strategies if they aren't working, reliability index
- Contact escalator / elevator companies and ask them to collect data on reliability
- If transportation is not available, subsidizing people to come by their own means
- Availability to book parking ahead of time
- Availability to request caption typists
- People should be able to book seating at the front of the room (even requiring glasses is a disability)
