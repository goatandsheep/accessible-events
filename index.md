If you are an event organizer, please try to have the following available or ask those who sign up if they require them:

# Before the Event:
- [ ] Create a strategy/method to ask people if they have needs before the event
- [ ] If you don't know how to accommodate someone's needs, ask them how they've been accommodated in the past
- [ ] Schedule events around religious holidays

## Don't Forget Backups: 
- [ ] If you are accommodating someone's needs, make sure you have an alternative for if (and when) things are no longer available, including people finishing special food or escalators stop working.

# Environment:
- [ ] Fragrance-free
- [ ] Regulated temperature

# Spaces
- [ ] Quiet room (could be a sleeping room)
- [ ] Baby feeding room

## ðŸš« Avoid
- [ ] Large crowds and low roofs. This creates poor ventilation.

# Access to Space
- [ ] Escalators/elevators/ramps if there are events/washrooms on multiple floors/steps/stages/podiums
    - [ ] Contact escalator/elevator companies and ask them to collect data on reliability
- [ ] If you are subsidizing transportation, such as a bus, ensure it is accessible or make available subsidies for people to come by their own means
- [ ] Bookable parking spots closer to the entrance
- [ ] Make sure stages have a ledge so people in wheelchairs don't roll off

# Access to Information
- [ ] Caption typists
- [ ] Bookable seating at the front of the room (even requiring glasses is a disability)
- [ ] Allow remote attendance

# Washrooms
- [ ] High toilets
- [ ] Do special washrooms have closing times within the time of your event?
- [ ] Clear policy to let people choose their restroom or make available gender neutral restrooms
- [ ] Feminine hygeine products and disposals in washrooms

# Dietary Accomodations
- [ ] Alternative food choices for people with dietary restrictions, such as allergies
- [ ] Transparent menu (when confirmed) for people with dietary restrictions

# After the event
- [ ] Survey the guests to find if they were accommodated appropriately
